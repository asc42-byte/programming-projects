    "1. Use [RDKit](https://www.rdkit.org/docs/GettingStartedInPython.html) to read the SMILES string into a `Mol` object.\n",
    "2. Add molecular coordinates to the `Mol` object.\n",
    "3. Determine the atom count, atomic symbols, coordinates, charge, and spin from\n",
    "the `Mol` object. Store the coordinates as a\n",
    "[NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/2.2/user/quickstart.html) array.\n",
    "4. Convert the coordinates from Angstroms to Bohr using [Pint](https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting/tutorial.html).\n",
    "5. Visualize the 3D structure using [3Dmol](https://3dmol.org/).\n",

    "Your code should do these tasks *without* calling `protomol`. However, you may\n",
